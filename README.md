## Modular JavaScript Ground Rules

- Self-contained code

* Everything associated with my module is in my module
* No global variables
* If a module manages more than one thing, it should be split up.

* Separation of Concerns
* DRY code: Do not repeat yourself

* Efficient DOM usage
* Very few $(selections)

* No memory leaks
* All events can be unbound
* Ensure event listeners go away.
